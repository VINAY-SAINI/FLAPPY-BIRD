Flappy Bird is an addictive arcade-style game where players control a bird named Faby, who persistently moves to the right. The objective is to navigate Faby through pairs of pipes with equally sized gaps placed at random heights.

## Gameplay:

- **Control Faby:** Tap the screen to make Faby ascend and release to descend. Timing is crucial to avoid collisions.
- **Avoid Obstacles:** Navigate Faby through the gaps between pipes. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the game.
- **Score Points:** Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point.
- **Challenge Yourself:** See how far you can guide Faby without crashing, and aim for a high score.
